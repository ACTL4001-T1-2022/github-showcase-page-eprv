This page will include details on our various processes and strategies to ensure the Raritan team's success and ensure stakeholder goals are met. The 3 main goals for this project included:  
* Become a top 10 team within 5 years. 
* Win the championship in 10 years. 
* Increase the Raritan GDP. 

The data provided to us included data on the players, data on economic factors as well as data on revenue from football. From this data, we met the probability of success and metrics towards the following goals: 
* 60.8% of ranking in top 10 in 5 years. 
* 76.9% of winning the championship in 10 years. 

Further detail for the GDP is provided in the economic section.

# Criteria For Selection

With the budget in mind and access to player statistics, EPRV Consulting took a ‘Moneyballesque’ approach towards team selection. This approach suggests that a player's ‘performance score’ should be emphasised over their current value and position. The idea refers to evaluation statistics based on realistic temperament rather than their own predetermined attributes. This permits a minimisation in cost for each game win and hence maximises revenue (Wolfe, Babiak, Cameron and Quinn, 2007). 

A performance score for each player was calculated based on the attributes of goalkeeping, defence, passing and shooting. Players may be interchanged between these attributes based on player strengths, except for those with strengths in the specialised attribute of goalkeeping.

The Table below attached shows five statistics relative to each attribute and their respective weightings to obtain a player score for each attribute. The statistics are chosen based on what some of the current best teams in the world, Liverpool, Brentford and Brambley, have used to base their success. In this, a higher emphasis is based on expected scores such as expected goals, assists (Schoenfeld, 2019), and rewards gameplay that progress the ball forward accurately. For defence and goalkeeping, it praises stopping progression, where clean opportunities are more valuable. 

| Position Score      |   Formula                                                                                     |            
| --------------      |   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|<b> Goalkeepers Score</b> | =  0.3 × save% + 0.2 × GApersave + 0.2 × PkSave% + 0.2 × CS + 0.1 × (Minutes Played/90) |
|<b>Defence Score</b> | = 0.2 × (Tak + int) + 0.2 × (Vs dribble Past) + 0.25 × PressuresSucc + 0.15 × BlocksBlocks + 0.2 × rr|
|<b>Passing Score </b>| = 0.4 × TotalCMP% + 0.2 × (A - xA) + 0.15 × ProgPass + 0.2KP + 0.05 × (Total Passes) | 
|<b>Shooting Score</b> | = 0.3 × (expected Goals - xG) + 0.2 × Standard SOT% + 0.2 × StandardG/Sh + 0.2 × Standard SOT/90 + 0.1 × ExpectednpxG/Sh|


Normal standardisation for identified, raw statistics was conducted, to place emphasis on statistic rankings relative to the average rather than raw score. Occasionally, some players' statistics were an outlier. These were identified and attributed to them playing a low number of minutes in the season. 


# Factors in Player Selection

The player scores and salaries were used to calculate ‘Performance Per Doubloon’ (PPD). This reflects the performance that each player contributes to the team per doubloon and formed a key factor in player selection. 

PPD = SCORE/SALARY

Further implemented quotas included maintaining a sufficient proportion of homegrown talent in the team, increasing growth in the number of fans, particularly those from Rarita, who may be more inclined to support and resonate with the homegrown players. 

Players from other nations were largely selected based on high performance scores and likely high reputations, increasing the brand value of the team. There is a clear connection between star player and brand equity of the team, to an extent where players become synonymous with their team. The figure below demonstrates the positive sway of star players on both on- and off-field transactions, which increase the equity of both the team and player. An investment of 10 million doubloons would be key in increasing brand awareness through highlighting our star players on various social media platforms.

# Probability Modelling
---

We obtained an average 13.6% annual probability of winning the FSA Championship for our chosen team, with a 17.1% annual probability of ranking within the top 10 members of the FSA. This resulted in a 76.9% probability of winning the FSA Championship within 10 years, and a 60.8% probability of ranking within the top 10 members of the FSA within 5 years. The 95% confidence intervals for the annual probabilities are shown below.

<p align="center">

     alt="95% Confidence Intervals" />
</p>

These probabilities were obtained through running beta regression models dependent on player position and other pertinent player statistics, some of which are listed below:

* <b> Defense:</b> 'Minutes play divided by 90', 'Interceptions', 'Clearances' ...
* <b> Passing:</b> 'Minutes play divided by 90', 'Pass completion percentage (5 - 15 yards)', 'Passes that directly lead to a shot (assisted shots)' ...
* <b> Shooting:</b> 'Minutes play divided by 90', 'Shots on target percentage', 'Average distance, in yards, from goal of all shots taken' ...
* <b> Goalkeeping:</b> 'Minutes play divided by 90', '% Match with clean sheet (CS)', 'Penalty kick goal against/ penalty kick attempt' ...


# Implementation Plan 

Our implementation plan follows three key milestones: short, medium and long term. Our goals are visualised on the following timeline below: 

<p align="center">
<img src="Timeline Plan.png" />
</p>

From our milestones, there are 3 key investments that are formed. How each investment is being measured for performance is summarised below:
* <b> Stadium Investment:</b> Revenue and GDP generated through stadium. 
* <b> Social Media Investment:</b> Year on year growth in social media engagement. 
* <b> Team Selection Methodology:</b> Increasing probability to win championship over time.


# Economic Impact
---
### Contributors to economic growth:
> While economic growth has been volatile and slow in the past, partly due to COVID-19, we believe that a variety of factors will be able to boost Rarita's economy closer to the global average.

* 500M Doubloon Stadium Investment
  * Stadium Location: East Rarita - Highest GDP contributions and likelihood of successful launch
* Acheiving Top 10 spot in championship within 5 years
* Decreasing influence of COVID-19 on Economy

>Assuming Sports and Tourism contributes around 2.2% to national GDP, Rarita's average historical GDP of 4.01% (excluding COVID-19 years as that is a non-factor now) will increase to 4.9%:
