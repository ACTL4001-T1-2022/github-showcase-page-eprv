# Economic Impact
---
### Contributors to economic growth:
> While economic growth has been volatile and slow in the past, partly due to COVID-19, we believe that a variety of factors will be able to boost Rarita's economy closer to the global average.

* 500M Doubloon Stadium Investment
  * Stadium Location: East Rarita - Highest GDP contributions and likelihood of succefuil launch
* Acheiving Top 10 spot in championship within 5 years
* Decreasing influence of COVID-19 on Economy

>Assuming Sports and Tourism contributes around 2.2% to national GDP, Rarita's average historical GDP of 4.01% (excluding COVID-19 years as that is a non-factor now) will increase to 4.9%:
