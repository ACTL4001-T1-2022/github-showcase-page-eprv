There are two main objectives that we focused on in our research and analysis. The first is the formulation of a competitive team with a high probability of winning the championship in 10 years. The second is how this competitive team would ultimately affect the Raritan economy. This entails a strategic implementation plan, forecasts of economic growth, and consideration of any risks along with mitigation strategies.
